React Music Player

This software is a simple interactive music web app built with React that lets users play songs, 
manage playlists, and enjoy a sleek modern interface inspired by real-world streaming apps.
Users can browse available songs, play and pause tracks, and create or delete custom playlists 
all while enjoying a clean purple-orange design theme with smooth transitions and synced mini-player controls.

Purpose

I created this project to experiment with dynamic web applications using the React framework.
It demonstrates how front-end frameworks like React can be used to generate content dynamically, 
respond to user input, and manage application state in real time.

Also serves as hands-on practice with:

    - Component-based architecture
    - State management with React hooks
    - LocalStorage persistence
    - Responsive design
    - Audio playback and UI synchronization

Features:

    - Play Songs — Real MP3 tracks imported from Pixabay Music (it is free)
    - Create and Manage Playlists — Add or remove songs dynamically
    - Persistent Data — Playlists are saved using localStorage
    - Interactive Player — Fully functional controls (Play, Pause, Next, Previous)
    - Modern UI — Purple-orange theme with responsive layouts
    - Dynamic Pages — Home, Player, and Playlist pages all generated dynamically

Tools Used:

    - Framework: React (Vite + JavaScript + SWC)
    - VS Code
    - Github
    - Local Vite dev server (runs via npm run dev)

Programming Languages:

    - JavaScript (React): Controls all interactivity, playback, and routing
    - HTML (JSX): Defines the app’s structure through reusable components
    - CSS: Styles the interface, progress bars, and animations

Hope You Liked It! :D

This was a super fun project that combines music, interactivity, and front-end design.
It’s both a creative experiment and a demonstration of dynamic web app development using React.
